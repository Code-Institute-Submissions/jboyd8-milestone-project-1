# Milestone Project 1
## Description
---
<p>This is my first milestone project on the Full Stack Web Developer Code Institute course. The aim is to create a responsive website using the HTML and CSS that I have learnt so far. We were allowed to use CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap as long as it was documented. I was given a brief of a project or could choose to do my own if my mentor beleived if would satify all the required criteria.</p>

<p>I chose to pick my own project as I liked the idea of creating something unique. I am a keen photographer in my spare time. This brought me the idea to create a beautifully designed photography website where I could showcase my work.</p>


## UX
---

When I started to design this website I wanted to ensure it was a sleek and simple design, almost minimalist. I knew that I wanted my images to be the main focal point of the website. This is why I decided to go with a full age image for the landing page. I didn't want this to be cluttered with anymore information other than what was required. The Gallery page would be the next most important as this would be where a user will go to view my images. Again I wanted to draw the users eye towards the images. My initial design was just to have images side by side with no text. However, when building the site I came across "cards" in bootstrap and decided that would be how I would set out my gallery. This was I could also provide the tech specs of how the Image was shot which other photographers may be interested to see.

The About and Contact pages were going to be the two most simple pages on my site. The contact page would just be a place where users could reach out to me with various queries. It would just contact in form. Similarly with the About page, this would just be split into two columns at desktop level, and one column at mobile level. The first column would contain a picture of mysefl and the second column would be where I would provide text.

In terms of keeping my website repititive and easy to learn, I wanted to ensure the navigation remianed in the same place where possible (it would fall into a collapsible button at mobile level). I wanted to ensure all my pages followed the same structure and color theme throughout the site with the exception of my landing page, due to the fact the background image would be full size.

## Testing
---
I have both manually tested the website and done automatic checks on it too. I used the web developer tools consistenly throughout the build to ensure my website was responsive at all screen sizes.
I did some automatic checked of my HTML and CSS structures in a validator(https://www.w3.org/) to ensure there were no errors. I did this continuously through the process.
