# Milestone Project 1
## Description
---
This is my first milestone project on the Full Stack Web Developer Code Institute course. The aim is to create a responsive website using the HTML and CSS that I have learnt so far. We were allowed to use CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap as long as it was documented. I was given a brief of a project or could choose to do my own if my mentor beleived if would satify all the required criteria.

I chose to pick my own project as I liked the idea of creating something unique. I am a keen photographer in my spare time. This brought me the idea to create a beautifully designed photography website where I could showcase my work.


## UX
---

When I started to design this website I wanted to ensure it was a sleek and simple design, almost minimalist. I knew that I wanted my images to be the main focal point of the website. This is why I decided to go with a full age image for the landing page. I didn't want this to be cluttered with anymore information other than what was required. The Gallery page would be the next most important as this would be where a user will go to view my images. Again I wanted to draw the users eye towards the images. My initial design was just to have images side by side with no text. However, when building the site I came across "cards" in bootstrap and decided that would be how I would set out my gallery. This was I could also provide the tech specs of how the Image was shot which other photographers may be interested to see.

The About and Contact pages were going to be the two most simple pages on my site. The contact page would just be a place where users could reach out to me with various queries. It would just contact in form. Similarly with the About page, this would just be split into two columns at desktop level, and one column at mobile level. The first column would contain a picture of mysefl and the second column would be where I would provide text.

In terms of keeping my website repititive and easy to learn, I wanted to ensure the navigation remianed in the same place where possible (it would fall into a collapsible button at mobile level). I wanted to ensure all my pages followed the same structure and color theme throughout the site with the exception of my landing page, due to the fact the background image would be full size.

Below are pictures of my wireframes that I created prior to development. My wireframes were just a bare bones design. As Development progressed a made various changes as to what I thought looked better etc. But I used the wireframes initially to transform the idea.

## Technologies Used
---
Below is a list of technologies I have used to build out my site.
* HTML5 - HTML5 provided the content and the structure of my website. I tried to use semantic elements where possible to ensure the best structure.
* CSS3 - CSS was used to style my pages.
* https://getbootstrap.com/- I used the Bootstrap framework alot during development. It was an efficeint way of creating the desired layout for my website. It also provided me with the possibilty to use ready made code for some     parts of my website, such as the Nav bar and the contact form.
* VSCode - This is my text editor. It has a built in terminal so I could do everything I needed to from one environment.
* Git - Git was used for version control. Allowing me to create backups whenever significant changed were made to my code.
* GitHub - This is where my repository is held externally. I will aslo use GitHub pages to deploy my website.
* Javascript/JQuery - This was imported via the Bootstrap framework to enable me to create a responsive collapsible nav bar at smaller screen sizes.
* https://fonts.google.com/ - I used this to import specific fonts I wanted to use on my website.
* https://fontawesome.com/ - I used this website to impor icons for my social links.
* https://htmlcolorcodes.com/ - I used this website in order to obtain hex codes whilst styling my pages.
* https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/ - I used css.hover to import some cool animations used when hovered over a link.
* http://clipartmag.com/ - I used this free website to get the favicon for my website.


## Testing
---
I have both manually tested the website and done automatic checks on it too. I used the web developer tools consistenly throughout the build to ensure my website was responsive at all screen sizes.
I did some automatic checks of my HTML and CSS structures in a validator(https://www.w3.org/) to ensure there were no errors. I did this continuously throughout the process. To ensure that my website was responsive across
different browsers, I downloaded other browsers so I could check on there. My default browser is Google Chrome which is where I did the majority of my tests. I find this the best tool to use when developing a website as I can refer to the developer tools when required. I also tested the website on Safari and Firefox, although these were done periodically.

If I spotted an error on my page, I would first change the styles etc in the dev tools so i could see a live update in the browser. Once I had figured out the issue I would then go back to VS Code and make the changes there. I also tried to commit my changes as much as possible. Like the testing I did this on an ongoing basis throughout development to ensure I had lots of versions and I could go back to a previous version should a major error occur.
