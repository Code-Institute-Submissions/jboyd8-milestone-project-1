<p> This is a list of technologies I have used to build out my site.</p>

## Testing
<p>I have both manually tested the website and done automatic checks on it too. I used the web developer tools consistenly throughout the build to ensure my website was responsive at all screen sizes.
I did some automatic checked of my HTML and CSS structures in a validator(https://www.w3.org/) to ensure there were no errors. I did this continuously through the process.</p>
