# Milestone Project 1
## Description
---
<p>This is my first milestone project on the Full Stack Web Developer Code Institute course. The aim is to create a responsive website using the HTML and CSS that I have learnt so far. We were allowed to use CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap as long as it was documented. I was given a brief of a project or could choose to do my own if my mentor beleived if would satify all the required criteria.</p>

<p>I chose to pick my own project as I liked the idea of creating something unique. I am a keen photographer in my spare time. This brought me the idea to create a beautifully designed photography website where I could showcase my work.</p>


## UX
---

<p>When I started to design this website I wanted to ensure it was a sleek and simple design, almost minimalist. I knew that I wanted my images to be the main focal point of the website. This is why I decided to go with a full age image for the landing page. I didn't want this to be cluttered with anymore information other than what was required. The Gallery page would be the next most important as this would be where a user will go to view my images.</p>

<p> Below is a list of technologies I have used to build out my site.</p>
* HTML<br>
* CSS<br>

* VSCode<br>
* Git<br>

## Testing
---
<p>I have both manually tested the website and done automatic checks on it too. I used the web developer tools consistenly throughout the build to ensure my website was responsive at all screen sizes.
I did some automatic checked of my HTML and CSS structures in a validator(https://www.w3.org/) to ensure there were no errors. I did this continuously through the process.</p>
